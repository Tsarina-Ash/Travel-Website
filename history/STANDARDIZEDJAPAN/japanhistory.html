        <div class= "box25">
          Japan is an island nation off Asia's east coast. It is made up of a long chain of islands that runs 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) across the western North Pacific Ocean in a northeast-southwest arc. The country's four main islands, from north to south, take up nearly all of the geographical area: Hokkaido (Hokkaido), Honshu (Honshu), Shikoku, and Kyushu (Kyushu). Honshu is the largest of the four, with Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku following closely behind. There are also numerous smaller islands, the largest of which being the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands to the south and west of Kyushu (including Okinawa) and the Izu, Bonin (Ogasawara), and Volcano (Kazan) islands to the south and east of central Honshu. Tokyo (Tokyo), the nation's capital, is one of the world's most populous cities, located in east-central Honshu.

        <div class= "box25">
          Japan is one of the most geologically unstable regions on the planet. The country receives about 1,000 tremors every year, the majority of which are mild, while large quakes, such as those that struck Tokyo-Yokohama in 1923 and Kbe in 1995, result in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. Volcanic eruptions are common, and at least 60 volcanoes have erupted violently in recorded history. Shwa Volcano on Hokkaido and Myjin Rock off the Beyoneisu (or Bayonnaise) Rocks in the Pacific are two volcanoes that have erupted since 1900. Among the major eruptions since 1980 are those of Mounts O (1983) and Mihara (1986) in the Izu Islands and Mount Unzen (1991) in Kyushu. The majority of the country's numerous hot springs are volcanic in nature. Many of the massive volcanoes (such as Mount Fuji) are conical in appearance, while others form steep lava domes (e.g., Mounts Dai and Unzen). Shield volcanoes (wide, gently sloping volcanic cones) are uncommon, as are vast lava plateaus.

          The Sengoku daimyo, who had survived the previous century's battles, entered an even more ferocious era of mutual combat between 1550 and 1560. Not only were these strong daimyo troubled by each other, but also by the emergence of common people within their domains. The daimyo attempted to address their problem by collecting land and people in order to expand their domains, and then by attempting to take control of the entire country. Of course, this necessitated the control of Kyto, Japan's political heartland since ancient times. Out of these deadly wars arose one Sengoku daimyo, Oda Nobunaga of Owari province (now Aichi prefecture), who became the first feudal unifier by capturing the capital

        <div class= "box25">
            Finally in August of 1939 the Soviet Union’s diplomats and Nazi Germany’s diplomats had signed the Molototov-Ribbentrop pact that gave the two nations an agreement to split Eastern Europe amongst themselves causing the Soviet Union to annex Estonia, Latvia, Lituania and Bessarabia which was controlled by would-be future ally of Germany, the Kingdom Of Romania, then to split Poland at Warsaw, running from Memel in the North to the Hungarian-owned Slovakia in the Center to the Black sea reaching near Bucharest. The Soviet Union had also gained plans to push the border near Leningrad (modern day Saint-Petersburg) north into Finland and to secure the iron that laid in northern Finland and on November 30th, 1939 the Soviet Union issued a state of war with Finland and tried to push into the “Mannerheim Line” which was a series of fortifications around Karjalas on the way from Leningrad to Helsinki, this war was dubbed the “Winter War” and ended in a peace treaty being signed in Moscow on March the 13th, 1940 giving up Karjala, Saavo and later Petsamo which was rich in nickel ore in the continuation war during Operation Barborrosa on June 22nd 1941 where the Soviet Union was invaded by Nazi Germany, Romania, Hungary, Italy and many other minor axis nations which had spared troops.

        <div class= "box25">
            The armistice for the continuation war was signed in September 1944, it wasn't until 1947 that in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947 that a peace treaty was signed between the two nations. Then later towards the end of the Continuation War, Marshal Mennherheim was appointed president of the Finnish republic and was shortly after succeeded in 1946 by J.K Paasikivi who led Finland into the start of the cold war helping the country maintain a neutral position but aligned with the Soviet Union due to a treaty signed in 1948 requiring Finland to assist the Soviet Union should Germany or any of its allies attack it ever again, the treaty was terminated in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union but prompted the Finnish economy to rely heavily on the Soviet Union so during the early 90’s Finland had begun to experience severe economic recession which was due to the Soviet Union collapsing and a overall European economic slowdown, then in the mid-1990’s the Finnish economy had begun to shift its industrial focus towards that of Western Europe which helped alleviate the mass unemployment of up to 20% in 1994 and gradually declined as its industry slowly recovered and adapted to the new market it found itself in. In 1955 under a U.S-Soviet agreement Finland was admitted to the United Nations as a member state, this mostly went unnoticed to the rest of the world but in 1975 it’s international impact was more widely known when the Security and Cooperation in Europe conference was ended in the Helsinki Accords, then in 1995 Finland became a member of the European Union then in 2002 the Euro had replaced the Finnish markka and by 2007 Nokia began to sell almost 40% of all mobile phones worldwide.

        <div class= "box25">
            The Republic Of Finland in 2020 exported ~66 Billion USD worth of goods world-wide, 64 % of these exports were shipped to: Germany (13.3%), Sweden (9.6%), The United States (8.3%), the Netherlands (6.4%), The People’s Republic Of China (5.1%), the Russian Republic (5%), the United Kingdom (3.5%), France (3%), Estonia (2.8%), Belgium (2.7%), Poland and Norway (2.4% each). With this, Finland’s top 10 exports can be found in mostly the industrial sector with machinery including computers: US$9.7 billion (14.7% of total exports), Paper, paper items: $7.3 billion (11.1%), Electrical machinery, equipment: $5.6 billion (8.5%) Vehicles: $5 billion (7.5%) Mineral fuels including oil: $4.9 billion (7.5%), Iron, steel: $4.1 billion (6.2%), Optical, technical, medical apparatus: $3.3 billion (4.9%), Wood: $2.9 billion (4.3%), Plastics, plastic articles: $2.3 billion (3.5%) and wood Pulp: $2.2 billion (3.3%). Machinery and computers have grown 1.5% more from 2019 and fossil fuels as a category of exports rapidly declining by 24.4% in total with wood pulp declining by almost 17.8% alone. Accompanying this shift to a more electronic and computer based economy came with a slight decrease in unemployment from 7.4% to 7.3% according to World Stop Exports and the International Monetary Fund. As pointed out by the International Monetary fund “The economy has performed well over the past three years but has slowed in 2019. There are some vulnerabilities in household finances, and productivity growth remains weak, with trend growth also constrained by adverse demographics…”

                As seen in the image above, Finland’s population is densely concentrated around major cities such as Helsinki, Turku, Oulu and Vaasa due to the extremely cold temperatures seen in the rest of the country. Thanks to the Arctic spanning through Northern FInland, most of the population is concentrated in the South-West on the coastline with the Baltic Sea.
