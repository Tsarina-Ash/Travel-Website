        <div class= "box25">
            Finland, lays along the Baltic sea and Arctic Sea with its coastline being around 2,760 miles (4,600 kilometers) to the north of Estonia, West of Sweden and Norway and East of the Russian Republic bridging the gap between Western Europe and Eastern Eurasia. The location of Finland places it north of the arctic circle causing it to have severe and extremely prolonged winters where temperatures can fall as low as -22 fahrenheit (-30 celsius), with this snow rarely melts from the mountains in the north bordering Scandinavia and short summers are to be expected with some regions. In some areas such as Lapland there can be a “midnight sun” where the sun is visible throughout the nights and mornings from May to July and during these months the temperatures can reach up to 80 fahrenheit (27 celsius). This leads Finland's natural outdoors to be rich as lush with forests and lakes, now national parks. One such extreme example of a national park is a trail through the Arctic, Pallas Yllastunturi National Park which is located in Northern Lapland. Then there’s Oulanka National Park in Eastern Lapland near Salla pushing along the Russian border with its raging rivers, while these were just two small examples of Finnish nature they are wonderful experiences to behold, discover more today.

        <div class= "box25">
            Later in 1543 the first Finnish ABC book was published creating the alphabet for Finnish speakers, then after that Helsinki was established inorder to compete trade with Talininn, while that happened in 1640 Turku, the capital of Finland at the time had established its first university that would later be moved to Helsinki in1828 soon after it was made the capital of the Royal Duchy Of Finland by the Russian Empire, Tsar Alexander The First in 1812. Then later in 1808 The Russian Empire and The Swedish Empire had gone to war in a war that would last from 1808-1809 where Russian would come out as the victor humiliating the Swedish Empire and obtaining Finland and while under Russian rule it was an autonomous country and received special recognition as a Grand Duchy having the Russian Emperor as the Governor General of Finland, this allowed for the Finnish senate whose members were Finns and were to give matters pertaining to Finland directly to the Russian Emperor in Saint-Petersburg by the FInnish Minister Secretary of State, this allowed FInland and the Emperor to have ease with communication without much bureaucracy nor Russian authorities interfering.

            Further down the line in 1863 Russian Emperor Alexander the first mandated the Language Decree which marked a milestone in Finnish history where FInnish had become an official administrative language then later the Conscription Act of 1878 achieved two important abilities, it gave Finland the ability to have an army of its own and marked the start of a draft, the army was not used in the Russian Civil War nor World War I. The during the Russian Civil war in 1917 the Finnish Parliament declared independence with parliament approving it on December 6th, 1917 under the leadership of president-elect Svinhufuvud, then in January 1918 the left-wing political parties staged a coup and the government retreated from Helsinki but later in May the government troops under General Gustaf Mannerheim crushed the coup attempt and in summer of 1919 the first presidential election happened where K.J Stahlberg was elected as the first president of the newly founded republic.

        <div class="filledspace">The Winter War And The Continuation War</div>   
        <div class= "box25">
            Finally in August of 1939 the Soviet Union’s diplomats and Nazi Germany’s diplomats had signed the Molototov-Ribbentrop pact that gave the two nations an agreement to split Eastern Europe amongst themselves causing the Soviet Union to annex Estonia, Latvia, Lituania and Bessarabia which was controlled by would-be future ally of Germany, the Kingdom Of Romania, then to split Poland at Warsaw, running from Memel in the North to the Hungarian-owned Slovakia in the Center to the Black sea reaching near Bucharest. The Soviet Union had also gained plans to push the border near Leningrad (modern day Saint-Petersburg) north into Finland and to secure the iron that laid in northern Finland and on November 30th, 1939 the Soviet Union issued a state of war with Finland and tried to push into the “Mannerheim Line” which was a series of fortifications around Karjalas on the way from Leningrad to Helsinki, this war was dubbed the “Winter War” and ended in a peace treaty being signed in Moscow on March the 13th, 1940 giving up Karjala, Saavo and later Petsamo which was rich in nickel ore in the continuation war during Operation Barborrosa on June 22nd 1941 where the Soviet Union was invaded by Nazi Germany, Romania, Hungary, Italy and many other minor axis nations which had spared troops.

            The armistice for the continuation war was signed in September 1944, it wasn't until 1947 that in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947 that a peace treaty was signed between the two nations. Then later towards the end of the Continuation War, Marshal Mennherheim was appointed president of the Finnish republic and was shortly after succeeded in 1946 by J.K Paasikivi who led Finland into the start of the cold war helping the country maintain a neutral position but aligned with the Soviet Union due to a treaty signed in 1948 requiring Finland to assist the Soviet Union should Germany or any of its allies attack it ever again, the treaty was terminated in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union but prompted the Finnish economy to rely heavily on the Soviet Union so during the early 90’s Finland had begun to experience severe economic recession which was due to the Soviet Union collapsing and a overall European economic slowdown, then in the mid-1990’s the Finnish economy had begun to shift its industrial focus towards that of Western Europe which helped alleviate the mass unemployment of up to 20% in 1994 and gradually declined as its industry slowly recovered and adapted to the new market it found itself in. In 1955 under a U.S-Soviet agreement Finland was admitted to the United Nations as a member state, this mostly went unnoticed to the rest of the world but in 1975 it’s international impact was more widely known when the Security and Cooperation in Europe conference was ended in the Helsinki Accords, then in 1995 Finland became a member of the European Union then in 2002 the Euro had replaced the Finnish markka and by 2007 Nokia began to sell almost 40% of all mobile phones worldwide.

        <div class="filledspace">The Modern Finnish Economy</div>  

        <div class= "box25">
            The Republic Of Finland in 2020 exported ~66 Billion USD worth of goods world-wide, 64 % of these exports were shipped to: Germany (13.3%), Sweden (9.6%), The United States (8.3%), the Netherlands (6.4%), The People’s Republic Of China (5.1%), the Russian Republic (5%), the United Kingdom (3.5%), France (3%), Estonia (2.8%), Belgium (2.7%), Poland and Norway (2.4% each). With this, Finland’s top 10 exports can be found in mostly the industrial sector with machinery including computers: US$9.7 billion (14.7% of total exports), Paper, paper items: $7.3 billion (11.1%), Electrical machinery, equipment: $5.6 billion (8.5%) Vehicles: $5 billion (7.5%) Mineral fuels including oil: $4.9 billion (7.5%), Iron, steel: $4.1 billion (6.2%), Optical, technical, medical apparatus: $3.3 billion (4.9%), Wood: $2.9 billion (4.3%), Plastics, plastic articles: $2.3 billion (3.5%) and wood Pulp: $2.2 billion (3.3%). Machinery and computers have grown 1.5% more from 2019 and fossil fuels as a category of exports rapidly declining by 24.4% in total with wood pulp declining by almost 17.8% alone. Accompanying this shift to a more electronic and computer based economy came with a slight decrease in unemployment from 7.4% to 7.3% according to World Stop Exports and the International Monetary Fund. As pointed out by the International Monetary fund “The economy has performed well over the past three years but has slowed in 2019. There are some vulnerabilities in household finances, and productivity growth remains weak, with trend growth also constrained by adverse demographics…”

                As seen in the image above, Finland’s population is densely concentrated around major cities such as Helsinki, Turku, Oulu and Vaasa due to the extremely cold temperatures seen in the rest of the country. Thanks to the Arctic spanning through Northern FInland, most of the population is concentrated in the South-West on the coastline with the Baltic Sea.
