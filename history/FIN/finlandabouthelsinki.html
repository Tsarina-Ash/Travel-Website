    Helsinki, the capital city of Finland has a long and devastating history with its comeback. The city had been formally founded by the Swedish King Gustav I in 1550 by moving some villages in the region together, then later in 1640 the city was moved 3 miles south towards the Baltic Sea which is considered to be the formal founding of modern-day Helsinki. Throughout the 1700’s the city struggled a lot with many events that occured in Europe at the time the first of which being a massive citywide plague in 1710 then shortly after that it was caught in the middle of the Swedish-Russian war where the Russians had occupied Helsinki during “The Great Hate” which lasted from 1713 to 1721 until The Swedish Empire and The Russian Empire signed a peace treaty then in 1748 The Swedish Empire built a massive fort in Helsinki to better protect it and led to it being nicknamed as the “Gibraltar Of The North”, however it led to a growth in the city’s economy since it laid in between Scandinavia and Eurasia causing it to become a trading hub past Saint Petersburg. Then in 1808 the majority of the city was burned down in a war by the Russians, soon after that in 1812 it was proclaimed the capital of Finland when Tsar Alexander reestablished it in Helsinki rather than Turku, which it had previously been. Soon after that Carl Ludwig Engel, a German-born architect and Johan Albrecht Ehrenström redesigned and rebuilt the city from the ground up into the modern city it is now and by the beginning of the 20th century it had begun to grow in population into around over 100,000 and by 1938 the Helsinki olympic stadium was completed but wasn’t utilized due to the outbreak of war in Europe and the winter war/continuation war with the Soviet Union and it’s allies where Helsinki was bombed but no major damage had occurred. Soon after the war it had begun to suburbanized throughout the 50’s and into the 60’s then later in 1952 it held the Olympic games. Then in 1971 the House Of Culture and Finlandia hall was completed which has hosted many impactful meetings such as the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a US-Soviet summit in between President George Bush and Premiere of The Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. Then in the year 200 it was designated out of nine cities in Europe as a “European City of Culture” and in 2012 it was designated by UNESCO as the “World Design Capital”.
